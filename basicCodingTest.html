14. In an MVC architecture, in which layer would you find HTML?

	In the View

15. In an MVC architecture, in which layer would you find SQL?

	In the Model

16. What is the difference between MVC and MVVM?

	My knowledge of MVVM comes from Angular where inputs on the frontend have a two way data binding with the model, and everything is updated asynchronysly.  In MVC changes go from the view, are filtered through the controller, and are then saved to the model, then the model is loaded to the view in the reverse process.

You need to merge changes committed and pushed to the master branch on origin to get the latest code from the rest of the team. Provide the Git command or commands to pull down and merge the changes from master to your dev_foo branch:

git pull origin master
